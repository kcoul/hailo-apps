# Running Applications (Pipeline and Standalone)

This guide explains how to run the ready-to-use AI applications included in this repository. It covers both:

- **Full-repository installation flow** (pipeline CLIs + all app groups)
- **Standalone app flow** (Python/C++ apps run independently)

If you still need installation steps, see the [Installation Guide](installation.md).

## Setup Environment
If you installed only a standalone app independently, you can skip this step and follow that app's local setup instructions in its README.

```bash
source setup_env.sh
```

## Useful CLI Utilities

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `get-usb-camera` | Detect and print available USB camera devices. |
| `hailo-download-resources` | Download/update model resources (by app group, model, or architecture). |
| `hailo-post-install` | Complete post-install setup (resources + postprocess compilation). |
| `hailo-audio-troubleshoot` | Audio diagnostics utility for voice workflows. |


## Available Applications

### Pipeline Applications

The following applications are available as command-line tools. Each one is a self-contained GStreamer pipeline that can be launched with a simple command.

> **Note:** Pipeline apps rely on resources (models, post-process `.so` files). In full installs this is handled by `install.sh`. For pip/manual installs, run `hailo-post-install` (see [Installation Guide](installation.md)).

## Run Guidance

### Pipeline apps (CLI)

- Use this flow when you installed the full repository.
- Activate environment per terminal:
```bash
source setup_env.sh
```
- Run any pipeline command directly (for example `hailo-detect`, `hailo-pose`, `hailo-seg`).
- See app-specific options with:
```bash
<command> --help
```
#### Common Pipeline Arguments

| Flag(s)                  | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--input, -i <source>`   | Specifies the input source. Common options include: `rpi`, `usb`, a device path like `/dev/video0`, or a path to a video file.                |
| `--arch <architecture>`  | Manually sets the Hailo device architecture (e.g., `hailo8`, `hailo8l`, `hailo10h`). If not provided, the system will auto-detect the device. |
| `--hef-path <path>`      | Path to a custom compiled HEF model file, allowing you to run your own trained models.                                                        |
| `--show-fps, -f`         | Displays a real-time Frames-Per-Second (FPS) counter on the output video window.                                                              |
| `--frame-rate, -r <fps>` | Sets the target input frame rate for the video source. Defaults to 30.                                                                        |
| `--disable-sync`         | Disables display synchronization to run the pipeline at maximum speed. This is ideal for benchmarking processing throughput.                  |
| `--disable-callback`     | Disables user-defined Python callback functions. Frame counting for watchdog continues. Use for performance benchmarking.                     |
| `--dump-dot`             | Generates a `pipeline.dot` file, which is a graph of the GStreamer pipeline that can be visualized with tools like Graphviz.                  |
| `--labels-json <path>`   | Path to a custom JSON file containing the labels for the classes your model can detect or classify.                                           |
| `--use-frame, -u`        | In applications with a Python callback, this flag indicates that the callback is responsible for providing the frame for display.             |
| `--enable-watchdog`      | Monitors the pipeline for stalls (no frames processed for 5s) and automatically rebuilds it. Works with --disable-callback.                   |
| `--log-level <level>`    | Set logging level: debug, info, warning, error, critical. Default: info. Can also use --debug for debug level.                                |
| `--log-file <path>`      | Optional log file path for persistent logging. Also respects $HAILO_LOG_FILE environment variable.                                            |

### Standalone apps (Python + C++)

- "Standalone" means standalone **installation flow** (no full `install.sh` flow required).
- Many standalone apps still depend on shared modules in this repo, so a repo clone is commonly required.
- Use each app README as source of truth for exact dependencies and run command.

Quick notes:
- Python CV standalone apps: usually install local `requirements.txt` in app directory.
- Python GenAI apps: install extras from repo root:
```bash
pip install -e ".[gen-ai]"
```
- C++ standalone apps: build/run from each app folder (`./build.sh`).

For C++ overview, see [CPP Examples README](../../hailo_apps/cpp/README.md).
